# interactive_mapping
A fun project where I experimented with creating an interactive web map of some interesting points of interest

The entire project revolved around creating the file: Map1_Holiday_Map.html

Open "Map1_Holiday_Map.html" to view a few highlights from the history of my travel around the world to date. I had a great time making it and I found it very nostaligic to look back on some great times. 

To see how this file is created, check out "Holiday_map.py" , "Holiday_data.csv" and "find_crds.py" 

I also made two other maps "Map2_Volcanoes_by_elevation.html" and "Map3_Population_by_country.html" to demonstrate different applications of folium. 

Thanks,
Chris
